A User Story Card should ideally comprise 3 parts: Card, Conversation and Confirmation

A User Story should focus on the who, what and why of a feature, not how.

	* As a recruiter, I want to post a job vacancy, so I can find a new team member.

As a 	[user role], 		I want to 		[goal], 		so I can 		[reason].
