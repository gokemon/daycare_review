**VERBS & NOUNS** part

A User Story Card should ideally comprise 3 parts: Card, Conversation and Confirmation

A User Story should focus on the who, what and why of a feature, not how.
For example, on a job site, two high-level User Stories might be:
	* As a job seeker, I want to search for a job, so I can advance my career.
	* As a recruiter, I want to post a job vacancy, so I can find a new team member.
This is a useful construct to give a consistent shape to User Stories, and to act as a constant reminder to focus on who, what and why:
As a 	[**user role**], 		I want to 		[**goal**], 		so I can 		[**reason**].
