# Goals #
- have it be touch and phone ready, HTML5 as much as possible, micro-data, so the phone is touch call.
- use HTML5 tags, and make it match my wireframe...
- learn to use Trello better
- learn to use Bootstrap better, rather than fighting it
- learn to use rails tools better
- build a Daycare providers model, Users model, and Comments model, and connect them


==========================================================
## Things to do ##
At the bottom of a Providers show page, display the comments about that daycare, with the authors name and date of creation.

Maybe keep see all reviews in one page, but also list what Daycare they belong to, as well as with the authors name.

clean up the other stuff not needed, like edits or shows, or destroy buttons, in places they don't go.
but this is part of the polishing process.

I am MORE than happy to have this thing work without crashing. 
*I consider this a success.*
