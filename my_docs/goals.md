# Goals #
- have it be touch and phone ready, HTML5 as much as possible, micro-data, so the phone is touch call.
- use HTML5 tags, and make it match my wireframe...
- learn to use Trello better
- learn to use Bootstrap better, rather than fighting it
- learn to use rails tools better
- build a Daycare providers model, Users model, and Comments model, and connect them


==========================================================
## Things to do ##
At the bottom of a Providers show page, display the comments about that daycare, with the authors name and date of creation.

Maybe keep see all reviews in one page, but also list what Daycare they belong to, as well as with the authors name.

clean up the other stuff not needed, like edits or shows, or destroy buttons, in places they don't go.
but this is part of the polishing process.

I am MORE than happy to have this thing work without crashing. 
*I consider this a success.*

## Future Plans ##

When a User makes a comment on a Daycare, the system emails the Providers admin, inviting them to join. 
They can join for a fee, which allows them to create an enhanced profile with extra details, photos they upload, a reply comment to comments made about their site, and **featured** at the top of the list, when searches are done, in their area.
Anytime a comment is made to a provider, the provider gets notified. If not a member, then invite provider admin to join, if already a member, then thank them.

To be able to have the search start with zip-code and search with-in a distance, like 5-10-15 miles.
